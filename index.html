    <h1>About this Project</h1>

    <p>
      <i><em><b>O, Miami</b></em></i> invites you to help give names to Miami's full moons. The names we often use for the full moon do not reflect Miami, its people and its environment. What does a "corn moon", or a "buck moon" or a "sturgeon moon" mean to us? Let's give
      each full moon its own identity that reflects on the place we call home. Submissions should draw inspiration from Miami’s seasons, ecology, culture, rhythms and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <strong>Phase 1, running February 1st to February 28th</strong>, you can suggest names for
      all twelve months + the bluemoon, and add a short explanation if you’d like. In <strong>Phase 2, March 1st to March 7th</strong>, we’ll
      open up voting to pick the favorites.
    </p>

    <p>
      The winning selections will be announced at the opening of the O, Miami Poetry Month Festivities, on <strong>April 1st,</strong> which, of course, happens to be a full moon!
    </p>

      <em>Phase 2: Voting</em> once nominations wrap.
